<h1>Who we are</h1>
<p> We're a group of 20-something nerdy ladies who enjoy getting together
	and discussing various nerdy topics like video games, Sci-Fi books, technology
	tabletop games and more!</p>
	
	<p>We created this site as a place for Geek Girls to come and converge on
	links from all across the Interwebz! We post links to sites about
	meetups, conventions, guild recruitment notices and more!
	It's sort of like the Pinterest for the nerdy chicks!

<h1>What we do</h1>
<p> Currently we're all employed in the technology field!
	But we accept nerd girls from any and all professions.
	Some of the areas we work in: software development, software testing, information security.</p>
	
	<p>We love the Internet, YouTube, playing video games and comic books. 
	Anything in the realm of science, technology, or engineering we enjoy pursuing!
